QuickBite is a responsive, multi-page website for a modern restaurant. This project was developed as a capstone project for the SnW (Semester 1) curriculum. It demonstrates a clean, modern front-end design built with pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, with a focus on user experience and responsive layouts.
